## How to use
By default, this mod will block your Headset from being available in the game.
To disable this, please set `bNoHmd` to false in Melon Preferences or uncheck the "No Hmd" toggle in the menu.

* Freecam is toggled on and off by pressing `F`
* The freecam menu is toggled with `F1` - Note, the menu will cause quite a big fps drop (c# slow)
